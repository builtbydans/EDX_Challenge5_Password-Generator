# EDX FE Bootcamp Challenge Five: Password Generator

## The Task

The task for the fifth module was to create a JavaScript program that allowed a user to generate a password based on a length they chose and from an option of multiple charset lists. The task involved storing user input, evaluating the conditions they met and generating a password based on those conditions.

## Room For Improvement

In this challenge, I believe the generatePassword() function could follow a more DRY principle. This also relies on the fact that the dataset could be converted into an object, meaning a users input could be stored and mapped directly to the chosen charset. Unfortunately, I was unable to work this out at this stage.
